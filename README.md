# s18-classroom-availability

This project was completed in a group of four for a senior design project at Clemson University using Scrum development methodologies. 


The problem: There are many unused classrooms on campus and specifically within the School of Computing building. We wished to remedy this.

The solution: Create a web application that displayed the what classes and/or events are happening in a specific classroom. To do this we used Google Calendar to hold the events and used the API to save and edit requests. Additionally, we saved all requests to a database where the events were verified before being sent to Google Calendar. We used HTML, JavaScript, and PHP as our stack.
